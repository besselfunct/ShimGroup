The purpose of this project is to establish a means by which
the large amount of research data generated on a regular basis
can be unified into a single database which can eventually be
mined by ML or other methods.

The Mathematica notebook in this folder contains the first 
pass of a script which imports multiple different filetypes
which are generated via QD synthesis, and subsequent device
fabrication.

TODO:
- Determine the best way to push to, and host a database with
the raw data
